2. Installation of the GMD Backend Generator BEG for Linux/386BSD
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Unpack the archive beg.1.75.tar.gz . The small Makefile will create a small
script 'beg' and will install the manual page in the directories you have
specified in the Makefile. Default is /usr/bin and /usr/man/man1 . If you
don't have write access to these directories, you must change them in the
Makefile before the installation. For these installation call

> make 

======================================================================

3. Use of Beg
-------------

The documentation is a little bit old, but you need no more documentation
for generating the Backend of the Modula-2 compiler MOCKA. To generate
sourcecode for the Modula-2 compiler MOCKA call

> cd mocka/src
> beg i386.cgd

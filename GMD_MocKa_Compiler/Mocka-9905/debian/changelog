mocka (9905-3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Fix run error and FTBFS with glibc 2.3, which moved errno to thread-local
    storage. (Closes: #397695)
    * When calling the included mc, use LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 to work around
      the issue at build time.
    * Fix sys/M2RTS-elf.s so new binaries use the new form of errno; makes
      the compiled binaries (including Mc itself) run properly.
